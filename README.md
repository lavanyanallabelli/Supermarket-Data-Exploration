# Supermarket Sales - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing sales data from a supermarket. The goal of this project is to uncover insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and overall business operations through visualizations and statistical summaries.

## Project Overview

Using Python and popular data science libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib), this project explores the following areas:

- **Sales Performance by Branch and Product Line**: Identify high-performing branches and popular product lines to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
- **Customer Shopping Patterns**: Analyze shopping behavior across demographics, including peak shopping times and gender-based product preferences.
- **Product Analysis and Ratings**: Evaluate customer satisfaction by analyzing rating distributions across different product lines.
- **Payment Method Preferences**: Examine the popularity of payment methods among customers.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understand relationships among numerical variables, including sales amounts, product ratings, and quantities.
